      <h2>Project 1: Science Expo</h2>
      <p>I hosted a science expo where my students showcased projects focused on climate change. Their presentations educated the community on important topics like climate justice and tree equity, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of these issues. It was a meaningful event that combined science education with community awareness and advocacy</p>
